# ML7331_team_project
A semester-long group project for a Master of Data Science course in Machine Learning.

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook and data files for our group project aimed at predicting the hospital re-admittance of diabetes patients.

## Structure
- **`LabOne_Diabetes_Submission.ipynb`**: A Jupyter notebook for setting project objectives and summarizing the data.
- **`LabOne_Diabetes_Submission.html`**: Rendered html file for the primary EDA.
- **`MiniLab_Diabetes_Submission.ipynb`**: A Jupyter notebook with classification models for predicting early hospital readmission.
- **`MiniLab_Diabetes_Submission.html`**: Rendered html file for readmission classification modeling.
- **`LabTwo_Classification_Submission.ipynb`**: A Jupyter notebook with classification models for predicting medication changes and regression models for length of hospitalization.
- **`LabTwo_Classification_Submission.html`**: Rendered html file for the classification and regression modeling.
- **`data/`**: Directory containing the raw and generated (PCA) data.
- **`plots/`**: Directory containing plots generated from the notebooks.
- **`archive_code/`**: Directory containing drafts of code from various team members.
